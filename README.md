# Deployment Instructions

To ensure your website works correctly on GitHub Pages, you must upload ALL files in this directory.

## Checklist

1.  **golf_club.html** (The main website file)
2.  **golf_background.png** (The background image)

## Common Issues

-   **Missing Image**: If you see the website structure but no background, it is likely because `golf_background.png` was not uploaded to the same repository folder as `golf_club.html`.
-   **Case Sensitivity**: Ensure the file name on GitHub is exactly `golf_background.png` (all lowercase).

## Steps

1.  Go to your GitHub repository.
2.  Click "Add file" > "Upload files".
3.  Drag and drop **both** `golf_club.html` and `golf_background.png`.
4.  Commit changes.
